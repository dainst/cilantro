# Feature: Localization of user interface elements

The user scenarios on this page are examples of "specification by example". They are described in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) syntax.

The scenarios can be summarized by a single rule: "serve the user-preferred version if it exists, else the English version if it exists, otherwise the German version, which is guaranteed to exist". This is indeed how the localization is implemented in the production code. However, this rule cannot be used for automated testing. 

The automated test in JavaScript that corresponds to the user scenarios is [here](../test/services_transl8_spec.js). The production code is tested against this specification.
